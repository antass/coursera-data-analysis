# Quiz 1

## Question 1
A web administrator is examining the web log file which provides information about people who visited his site. In the log file, the administrator sees a value for the internet protocol (IP) address of "127.0.0.1", a user ID of "frank" for the individual accessing the file and "2326", measured in bytes, for the size of the file returned to the user. Which of the following are true? Here is a description of a web log file in common log format: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format. Here is a description of an IP address: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address

**The IP address and the user ID are qualitative variables and the number of bytes returned is quantitative.**

## Question 2
Suppose that random variable X follows a Poisson distribution with rate parameter L. If we increase the value of L, which of the following is true?

~~The center increases but the spread remains unchanged.~~
**Both the spread and the center increase.**

## Question 3
Run the following commands to create a data frame in R with measurements for 30 men describing their height in centimeters, weight in kilograms, and a logical indicator for whether they have a daughter or not.

```{r}
set.seed(31)
heightsCM <- rnorm(30,mean=188, sd=5)
weightsK <- rnorm(30,mean=84,sd=3)
hasDaughter <- sample(c(TRUE,FALSE),size=30,replace=T) 
dataFrame <- data.frame(heightsCM,weightsK,hasDaughter)
```

Subset the data frame to only the individuals that are greater than 188 centimeters tall. Assign this subset to a data frame called dataFrameSubset. Then run this command: mean(dataFrameSubset$weightsK) to get the average weight among this subset of men in the data. What is the value that is produced?

```{r}
dataFrameSubset <- subset(dataFrame, heightsCM > 188)
mean(dataFrameSubset$weightsK)set.seed(41)
```

**82.40639**

## Question 4
Run a command to generate 100 Cauchy random variables with default parameters and assign them to a vector cauchyValues immediately after running the command

```{r}
set.seed(41)
cauchyValues <- rcauchy(100)
```

Then run a command to sample 10 values with replacement from cauchyValues immediately after running the command

```{r}
set.seed(415)
sample(cauchyValues, 10, replace=TRUE)
```

What are the first three values of the resulting sample? Note: It is critical that you run the set.seed commands immediately before the commands to perform the data generation and sampling or you will get the wrong answer.

**0.8084719, -1.1122863, 0.3716671**

## Question 5
We take a random sample of individuals in a population and identify whether they smoke and if they have cancer. We observe that there is a strong relationship between whether a person in the sample smoked or not and whether they have lung cancer. We claim that the smoking is related to lung cancer in the larger population.

**This is an example of an inferential data analysis.**

## Question 6
Suppose that we collect data on every goal scored in the Spanish Primera Division (http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/scorers/_/league/esp.1/spanish-primera-division?cc=5901) in the 2011/2012 and 2012/2013 seasons. We use the data from 2011/2012 to build a model to predict the number of goals scored in 2012/2013. What is the complete list of labels that apply to this data set?

**Census, prediction, longitudinal**

## Question 7
What are the three characteristics of tidy data?

**1. Each variable forms a column, 2. Each observation forms a row, 3. Each table/file stores data about one kind of observation.**

## Question 8
Which of the following are components of data processing that should be recorded for use in later data analyses?

**All of the above**

## Question 9
When writing about data, what does it mean when we write: X | Y = y?

**We are referring to the random variable X when we know the random variable Y has value y. The distribution of this variable may be different than the distribution of the variable X when Y is also random.**

## Question 10
Suppose we take a sample of people in Baltimore and observe that younger people have taken more Coursera courses. We use an inferential data analysis to show a relationship between age and Coursera courses. Which of the following statements are true based only on our analysis?

**If we took a census of all people in Baltimore, we would expect to see that the younger a person was, the more likely they were to have taken a Coursera course.**
