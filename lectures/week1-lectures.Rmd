* *where to get help?*
  * message boards are one place... to ask questions 
* *where to look for answers?*
  * ( before asking the question to the boards... )
  * R questions?
    * [Roger Peng's video lecture series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3)
    * search Roger's R class forums 
    * [R mailing list](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html)
    * search for R on Stack Overflow 
   * stats questions?
     * forums...
     * [CrossValidated](http://stats.stackexchange.com/) 
* *"Googling..."*
  * CrossValidated for general data analysis questions 
  * "half the hurdle" → what do you call "data analysis" in your given field?
    * e.g., data analysis? or econometrics? or biostatistics?

* (( start w/ the Wikipedia definition )) → and/but break it down 
  * Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.
* **set of items** → population or sample 
* **variables** → characteristic of what you're measuring 
  * qualitative (categorical) or quantitative (numerical) 
* **raw data** → "original source" 
  * usually hard to manipulate 
* **processed data** → data that is ready for analysis 
  * (after you've sliced/diced it)
  * e.g., normalizing values; dealing with outliers; transforming sentinel values; eliminating values that are of no interest...
* ( example of pipeline b/w raw and processed data )
  * the gene sequencing case study (what is the "raw data"? the image? the intensity values? the "raw" summary?)
* processed data → what does it look like?
  * clean columns, clean rows (tables, data frames) 
* "What is big data?"
  * "Any data that is too big to analyze with a single computer."
  * ( but that's easy to dispute depending on any number of factors )
  * "so easy to collect so much data in so little time and for so little money"



Representing Data
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* "How do we represent data?" 
  * important to know how to write about it → b/c _The Point_ is communicating 
* How do we write about data?
  * each data point gets a capital letter
    * e.g., _H_ for height 
    * sub-script numerals if you have more than one for that type
  * _Y_ generally represents outcomes, _X_ for covariates
* **Randomness**
  * _X_ & _Y_ as "random variables" 
  * a variable is random b/c it is an incompletely measured variable 
    * or it's a random draw from a population 
  * _X = x_ → fixing _X_ (random quantity _X_) to be observed/fixed _x_ 
* example : coin flip (canonical "random") 
  * and/but so : studies indicate that even the coin flip can be deterministic 
    * so when you're marking something as random it's b/c you don't have the data to make a claim about it in a deterministic fashion 
* **Distributions**
  * _Pr_ = probability (b/w 0 and 1, must add up to 1)
  * our coin flip probability written as:
    * _Pr(X = 1) = 0.5 and Pr(X = 0) = 0.5_
      * in other words: 50/50 chance of heads or tails
* continuous vs. discrete distributions 
  * discrete → qualitative 
  * continuous → quantitative (ranges) 
* parameters 
  * "Distributions are defined by a set of fixed values called _parameters_."
  * usually represented w/ Greek letters 
    * _N(μ,σ)_ or _Poisson(λ)_ 
  * e.g., _X ~ N(μ,σ)_
    * translation: X has the N(μ,σ) distribution 
* 3 most important parameters 
  * _E[X]_ → expectation of X (measures the "center"; usually mean?) 
  * _Var[X]_ → variance of X 
  * _SD[X]_ → standard deviation 
* **Conditioning**
  * _X|μ_ → X is a random variable with fixed parameter μ 
* example distribution : **Binomial** 
  * coin flips:
  * _Bin(n, p)_
  * _X ~ Bin(10, 0.5)_
* example distribution : **Normal**
  * _N(μ,σ)_
    * μ = mean
    * σ = standard deviation
  * _X ~ N(0, 1)_
  * ( "probability density function" )
* example distribution : **Uniform**
  * "all values are equally likely" 
  * _U(α, β)_
    * _α, β_ = boundaries of which values we consider to be equally likely
  * X ~ U(0, 1) 
* **Changing parameters**
  * Normal distribution:
    * _X ~ N(0, 1) , E[X] = μ = 0, Var[X] = σ² = 1_
      * vs. 
    * _X ~ N(0, 5) , E[X] = μ = 0, Var[X] = σ² = 25_
      * (a fatter "bell curve" function)
      * vs. 
    * _X ~ N(5, 1) , E[X] = μ = 5, Var[X] = σ² = 1_
      * (skewed)
  * Binomial:
    * _X ~ Bin(10, 0.5), E[X] = n × p = 5, Var[X] = n × p (1 - p) = 2.5_
      * vs.
    * _X ~ Bin(10, 0.8), E[X] = n × p = 8, Var[X] = n × p (1 - p) = 1.6_
      * (skewed)
  * CONDITION:
    * Suppose : _Y ~ N(X, 1) and X ~ N(0, 1), then distribution of Y|X = 5_
    * (( conditioning can help reduce some of the variance b/c it holds one of the random variables constant, meaning that the function does NOT need to account for the variance of both (just the one) ))

[transcript](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/subtitles?q=51_en&format=txt)

* (( more/less an intro to R and its core concepts ))
  * recommended video: [Peng's "Lecture 2a: Data Types" (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AQM-yUX9zg)
* data types:
  * `character` ("Jeff") 
  * `numeric` (1) 
  * `integer` (1L) 
  * `logical` (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) 
  * `vectors` (get familiar w/ these...; homogenous types)
  * `lists` (like vectors, but heterogeneous)
  * `matrices` (you know... like from math class)
  * data frames (get familiar w/ these → most of our data will be in data frames)
    * think : "like a spreadsheet" (columns & row)
  * **factors** → "Qualitative variables that can be included in models"
    * `as.factor`
    * very important!! 
  * missing values (`NA`)
* subsetting 
  * bracket notation
    * `vector[i]` → where i is an index
    * `vector[c(1:5)]` → where you give the brackets a vector of the indices (plural) you want to get back out 
  * bracket notation for specific rows, columns in a data frame 
    * `dataframe[1, 2:5]`
      * `[row(s), column(s)]`
  * `$dollarSignOperator` 
    * `my.data$columnName`
  * more bracket notation → with an expression for filtering
    * `my.data[heights < 190, ]`
* variable naming conventions 
  * acceptable: camelCase, with_underscores
  * idiomatic: with.dots 
* Style guides are out there for R:
  * e.g., [Google's R style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/google-r-style.html)

[transcript](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/subtitles?q=53_en&format=txt)

* basics of simulation →
  * primarily (at beginning of class) for generating idealized data sets 
* 3 categories:
  * distributions
    * all functions start with `r`
  * densities
    * all functions start with `d`
  * sampling
* "r functions" 
  * to generate data → example:
```{r}
coin.flips <- rbinom(10, size=10, prob=0.5)
```
* "d functions"
  * to generate data → example:
  * (see also : `dbinom`) 
```{r}
x <- seq(from=-5, to=5, length=10)
normal.density <- dnorm(x, mean=0, sd=1)
round(normal.density, 2)
```
* sample → to sample from data we already have
  * see also : prob arg for probabilities (takes a vector of probabilities (remember: probabilities must sum to 1))
```{r}
heights <- rnorm(100, mean=188, sd=3)
sample(heights, size=10, replace=TRUE)
```
* `set.seed(12345) # or whatever int you want for an arg`
  * anyway : that is a way of saying "repeatably random" 
* see also : [Peng's "Simulation in R" (video)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvv4IA8PEzw)



Types of Data Analysis Questions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[slides](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7710864/007typesOfQuestions/index.html) |
[video](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/download.mp4?lecture_id=55) |
[transcript](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/subtitles?q=55_en&format=txt)

_"What kind of question are you trying to answer?"_ try categories:

* **descriptive** → describe something 
  * usually on a "census" or population 
* **exploratory** → goal : find relationships that you didn't necessarily know about
  * ok to do on a census, but more commonly on a smaller data set 
  * this type of analysis is usually where you need to remember "correlation does not equal causation"
    * (( you are looking for clues here about where to look next )) 
* **inferential** → goal : use a small sample to imply something about a larger population 
  * must: estimate the qty. you care about & the quantify the uncertainty you have about that estimate 
  * case study: look at air pollution in 500 counties across the USA, make inferences about air pollution throughout the USA
* **predictive** → goal : use the data on some objects to predict values for another object
  * REMEMBER : just because "x predicts y" does not mean that "x _causes_ y"
  * prediction is very hard 
  * case study : [Nate Silver's 538 blog](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/)
  * case study : [Forbes.com: How Target Figured Out A Teen Girl Was Pregnant Before Her Father Did](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/)
* **causal** → goal : find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change 
  * randomized studies more/less required 
  * usually ID'd as "average effects" 
  * "the gold standard" 
  * controlling variables & "doing experiments" so be go beyond "x _predicts_ y"
    * ( however : again : even with "causal" studies, it can be difficult to prove a causal relationship )
* **mechanistic** → goal : Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects.
  * incredibly hard 
  * try to "prove" that by manipulating variable(s) that you can predict changes in other variable(s)
    * (( complex relationships w/in systems ))



Sources of Data Sets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[slides](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7710864/008sourcesOfDataSets/index.html) |
[video](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/download.mp4?lecture_id=57) |
[transcript](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/subtitles?q=57_en&format=txt)

* data are defined by how they are collected:
* **census** → usually for descriptive studies 
  * census → population → measure all variables across each individual in the population 
* **observational study** → ...inferential
  * random sample from your target population
    * based on that sample, extrapolate about the population 
* **convenience sample** → all types (may be biases)
  * a sample, but not random (e.g., you can't travel too far to get your subjects)
* **randomized trial** → mandatory for causal studies 
  * get your sample, assign different treatments to different groups 
    * note: hold all other variables constant 
* (main above, other below)
* **prediction study**
  * need 2 data sets → training set (build predictive model) + test set (evaluate predictive model)
  * result of 1st set: build the predictive model
  * 2nd time around : use your predictive model and see if you can validate it 
* **studies over time** (_cross-sectional_, _longitudinal_)
  * cross-sectional: pick a time point, and measure your sample at that time point (!????)
  * longitudinal: assign individuals from your sample, and follow them over a period of time (measuring your variables again and again and again...)
* **retrospective** (_inferential_) 
  * do an "exposure" → "fast forward" to the end, and take your measurements then 
  * noted : it's inferential (not predictive, not causal)
