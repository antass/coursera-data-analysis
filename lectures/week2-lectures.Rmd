### what constitutes a data analysis?

→ start w/ these definitions for steps 

1. **define question(s)** → scientific or business question you want to answer w/ data
   - usually starts with a general question ("Can I automatically detect if an email is spam?")
   - make the question more specific ("Can I use quantitative methods to analyze email and see if it is spam?")
2. **define ideal data set** → "if time/money were no object"
   - what kind of analysis? (descriptive? inferential? [see prev. lectures])
     - select type of sample (census? random sample?)
   - let the type of analysis guide the type of census/sample 
3. **determine what data you can access**
   - do the data exist? can you tap into it? can you buy it?
   - is this a sample that you need to conduct/gather yourself?
4. **obtain data**
   - try to obtain raw data 
   - reference the source
     - load from the internet? URL + date/time of access
5. **clean data** → remove "too much" data; filter or fix data that's missing or otherwise "damaged"
   - raw data needs to be processed
     - if it was pre-processed: get info. about how it was processed
   - _understand_ the source of the data (census? sample? etc.)
   - do you need to reformat? subsample?
   - _determine if the data are good enough_
   - "There's nothing worse than an analysis that's correctly performed, but on the wrong data set."
6. **exploratory analysis**
   - ...explore the data: what does it have? what guesses can we make about it?
   - (_literally_ "just explore" the data)
7. **statistical prediction/modeling** → 
   - should be informed by exploratory analysis 
     - _but_ stick to your question! (don't make this all ad-hoc/post-hoc)
   - here is where you need to start thinking about prior assumptions
     - (have you changed anything about your data?) 
   - "get a measure of uncertainty" 
      - calculate the predictive values 
      - apply that model to the test set 
   - (e.g., determine your error rate ("error rate" → measure of uncertainty)
8. **interpret results** → plain language
   - use appropriate language (descriptive analysis? then say you "described" -- don't imply more explanatory power than you have) 
   - explain the associations you observed in your data set 
     - use units that can be understood by non-technical audience 
9. **challenge results** → potential failings of the model?
   - challenge questions: 
     - was it the right question?
     - was it the right data source?
     - did we process the data correctly?
     - did we do the right analysis?
     - did we come to sensible conclusions?
   - challenge your measures of uncertainty 
     - and/or → any other "uncertainties" you didn't have to start with?
10. **synthesize** / write up
    - "lead with the question"
    - summarize the analysis
    - don't include every analysis
      - just the ones you need to "tell your story"
      - and/or the ones that substantiate a claim
      - ...or refute a challenge
    - include "pretty" figures 
11. **create reproducible code**
    - you want other people to be able to run the code, reproduce your results 
    - Rmarkdown FTW

### Some "follow along" exercises

```{r}
library(kernlab)
data(spam)

set.seed(3425)
trainIndicator <- rbinom(4601, size=1, prob=0.5)

table(trainIndicator)

trainSpam <- spam[trainIndicator==1,]
testSpam <- spam[trainIndicator==0,]

#plot(trainSpam$capitalAve ~ trainSpam$type)
plot(log10(trainSpam$capitalAve + 1) ~ trainSpam$type)

hCluster <- hclust(dist(t(log10(trainSpam[,1:55] + 1))))
plot(hCluster)
```

### directory structure

A proposed sensible convention to follow for directory structures:

- **`data`**
  - **`raw`**
    - keep a copy of the data you've retrieved (URL? when?)
    - doesn't matter how messy -- raw for a reason
  - **`processed`**
    - tidy (should be easy to work with the processed files)
    - important that it's easy to see which script did the processing
- **`figures`**
  - **`exploratory`**
    - the "fun figures" -- the ones that aren't important b/c you're just playing ("seeing what you can see")
  - **`final`**
    - clearly labeled
    - easy to read
    - "polished" versions of the exploratory figures that you identified as most relevant 
- **`R`** (`src/R`?)
  - **`raw`**
    - less well commented (and/but → the comments are to help yourself)
    - have multiple versions if needed
    - (( why not track versions in VCS? ))
    - many will be discarded and/or whittled down...
  - **`final`**
    - clear comments (these are the ones you're going to share)
    - include processing details
    - only include scripts that are relevant to your final results (final analysis)
  - **R Markdown** (optional)
    - an alternative (??) to "final"
    - include your comments/analysis ... *and* the R code
- **`text`**
  - **`readme`** (obviated by R Markdown)
    - ("not necessary if you're using R Markdown")
    - should contain step-by-step instructions for analysis
  - **analysis**
    - include:
      - title
      - introduction/motivation
      - methods (what stats did you use?)
      - results (including measures of uncertainty)
      - conclusions
    - actual data analysis report itself
    - remember: don't include every analysis that you did
      - just the most relevant ones
    - include references → e.g., citations, acknowledgments
      - did you you use any libraries/packages? (credit them!)
      - cite references for important statistical techniques (that may fall outside "the usual" stats)

- (( most of it in the week2-lectures.Rmd file... ))
- get/set your working directory:
  - relative & absolute paths
```{r}
getwd()
setwd('~/Desktop/coursera-data-analysis')
```
- types of data files... (examples)
  - tab-delimited
  - comma-separated
  - Excel
  - JSON
  - HTML/XML
  - Databases (advanced)
- where can you get data? (examples)
  - colleagues
  - from the web
  - ...or API
  - page scraping
- `download.file(url, [destination.file], [method])` → downloads a file from a URL
  - (( example / case study → data.baltimorecity.gov traffic camera data )) 
  - side note : you'll need to use `method="curl"` if you have run into an `https`
  - `list.files('./directory')`
- `read.table()` and `read.csv()`
  - `read.table()` reads the file into memory -- so careful that you don't run out of RAM in the process
  - (( back to the camera data case study ))
  - `read.csv()` is a convenience function that wraps `read.table()` with some defaults already set 
- Excel → `read.xlsx()`
  - but you need `xlsx` package
  - `read.xlsx2()`
- also → instead of specifying the file → `file.choose()`
  - → and now you're prompted to specify the file (w/ the Finder window) 
- // // onward to 2nd video // //
- "you can make connections with..." (function names line up w/ the connection type)
  - `file`
  - `url` 
  - `gzfile`
  - `bzfile`
  - `?connections` → for help on connections
  - **remember to close connections!**
- `readLines()` → 
  - `file()` to open the connection (file returns a connection)
    - `read.csv(connection)`
    - `close(connection)`
    - and/but → not much use? you could just give the file name to `read.csv()`
  - ditto above w/ `url()`
  - `RJSONIO` (library)
    - `fromJSON(connection)` → more/less automatically converted into an R list 
    - (( don't expect to deal w/ much JSON in this class ))
- `write.table()` →
  - try to start w/ a data frame & pass that to `write.table()`
- `save()` + `save.image()`
  - saves to a special "R binary" 
- `load()`
  - bring in an "R binary" to auto-magically load & re-create your workspace
  - side note : `rm(list=ls())` → "like rm -rf for your R workspace"
- `paste()` + `paste0()` → (( a string concat function ))
- getting data off of web pages... 
  - readlines from a URL connection...
  - XML package → `htmlTreeParse()`
   - "pretty advanced data scraping" (just general interest for the purposes of this lecture/class) 
- other interesting packages 
  - `httr` → for http connections
  - `RMySQL`
  - `bigmemory` → for data that is too big for your memory 
  - `RHadoop`
  - `foreign` → for getting data from SAS or SPSS etc.

## Summarizing Data 

[slides](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7710864/courseraPublic/week2/007summarizingData/index.html) |

[video](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/download.mp4?lecture_id=79)

- "Why summarize?"
  - data often too big to look at the whole thing
  - first steps:
    - summarize: any problems?
      - missing values → values outside the expected range → mislabeled data 
    - summarize: any patterns?
- case study : Earthquake data 
  - (( TODO → look at the slides & follow along w/ the example ))
  - techniques ... commands to run:
    - `dim()` → get dimensions
    - `names()` → get the variable names
    - `nrow()` & `ncol()` → 
    - `quantile()` → summarize w/ the quantiles 
    - `summary()` → ...a summary
    - `sapply(myData[1,], class)` → determine whether the data in a given column are of the right kind
    - `unique()` → summarize qualitative variables (what are your categories in a given variable?)
    - `length()` → like unique, but just the sum of the unique values 
    - `table(myData$Src)` → lists each unique value & the frequency for that unique value 
      - also: `table(myData$Src, myData$Version)` → cell of `Src` x `Version` (sweet) 
    - `any(myData$Lat[1:10] > 40)` → "Are any of the 1st 10 latitudes greater than 40?"
    - `all(myData$Lat[1:10] > 40)` → "Are all of the 1st 10 latitudes greater than 40?"
    - `subset()` w/ `&` (and) operator → e.g.,
      - `myData[myData$Lat > 0 & myData$Lon > 0, c("Lat", "Lon")]`
      - variation on that: `subset()` w/ `|` (or) operator 
- case study : peer review 
  - (( TODO → look at the slides & follow along w/ the example )) 
  - `is.na()` → to look for missing values
  - `rowSums()` & `rowMeans()` & `colSums()` & `colMeans()`



Data Munging Basics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[slides](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7710864/courseraPublic/week2/008dataMungingBasics/index.html) |
[transcript](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/subtitles?q=81_en&format=txt) |
[video](https://class.coursera.org/dataanalysis-001/lecture/download.mp4?lecture_id=81)
- RECALL : **["Tidy Data"](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)** → this is where you want to end up → **_Tidy Data_ is:**
  - Variables in columns
  - Observations in rows
  - Tables hold elements of one kind only
  - (_addendum_) Plus:
    - col names are easy to use (informative)
    - row names are easy...
    - obvious mistakes are removed
    - variable names are internally consistent 
    - appropriate transformed variables have been added 
      - (e.g., if you have "sex = male" and "sex = man" → normalize on just one)
- common munging operations:
  - **fix variable names** → fix character vectors 
    - `tolower()` & `toupper()`
       - e.g., `tolower(names(cameraData))`
    - `strsplit()` → `strsplit(names(cameraData), "\\.")`
      - (( slides have a good example combining w/ `sapply`) 
    - `sub()` & `gsub()`
      - e.g., `sub("_", "", names(reviews))` → "substitute the empty string for every underscore you find in the names in the reviews data"
        - `gsub` → "global sub" 
  - **quantitative variables as ranges**
    - `cut()` → e.g., `cut(reviews$time_left, seq(0, 3600, by=600))`
      - can be useful : move continuous values into buckets (then just consider the buckets)
      - (( gives you a "factor" variable instead of a quantitative variable ))
    - alternative → `cut2()` (from `Hmisc` library)
      - automatically breaks it up (by quantile?) 
    - NOTED : good idea → use cut to make the ranges, but don't throw them away -- add them to your data frame:
      - `reviews$timeRanges <- cut2(reviews$time_left, g=6)`
  - create new var names
  - **merge data sets**
    - `merge()` → examples:
      - `mergedData <- merge(reviews, solutions, all=TRUE)`
      - `mergedData2 <- merge(reviews, solutions, by.x="solution_id", by.y="id", all=TRUE)`
  - **reshape data** → e.g., sorting 
    - `sort()` → e.g., `sort(mergedData$reviewer_id)[1:10]`
    - `order()` → e.g., `order(mergedData$reviewer_id)[1:10]`
      - reorder a data frame: `mergedData[order(mergedData$reviewer_id),]`
      - reorder by multiple variables: `mergedData[order(mergedData$reviewer_id, mergedData$id),]`
    - "changing the shape"
      - `melt()` (in reshape package) → `melt(misShaped, id.vars="people", variable.name="treatment", value.name="value")`
  - deal w/ missing data
  - deal w/ outliers
  - take transforms of data
  - check on or remove inconsistent values
- REMEMBER : record your steps! ("Show your work!")
- **90% of your effort will be spent in the munging operations**
  - no glory here, but that's where the work is
